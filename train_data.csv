3,Description: What causes back and prostate paining?,Patient: Two years ago I was treated for prostate cancer. Completed treatments and PSA is less than 1. This week I noticed bright red blood droplets after urinating following a bowel movement. I continue to have flank and back pain and it is persistent. No other blood droplets and no problems urinating and no burning. There is some slight prostate aching. Do you think prostatitis or kidney stone?,"Doctor: Hi,Thanks for writing in.Drops of blood after urinating are usually due to a condition affecting the prostate and urethra. Rarely it can be linked to the urinary bladder. It is important to get evaluated by your urologist as you have already been treated for prostate in the past.Doing an ultrasound scan to assess the bladder, prostate and kidneys is important. If there is suspicion in the bladder and urethra then a cystoscopy might also be indicated. Few bright drops of blood after urination can also be due to a stricture that might have formed in the urethra or a small injury to the prostatic urethra due to straining at urination.Doing a routine urine test for red blood cells is also advised. Please do not worry."

Any idea of what this would be or what it is caused by. My first thought was  a parasite, but I have been reading things about undigested fat, etc Please hel[!","Doctor: Hi....by what you quote I feel it could be just stool particles mixed with watery stools.

But if the kid is active and normal you need not worry.Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

Never happened before, I know what pnuemonia feels like and it wasn't that. Never had any digestion problems before either.  Any ideas?","Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Lower chest and upper abdominal pain is mostly seen with either lung diseases or abdominal diseases. Lung diseases like pleural effusion, pneumonia etc cant cause similar symptoms. Abdominal diseases like gastritis, intestinal infection etc can also cause similar symptoms.

18,Description: Q. What is the treatment for recurrent iridocyclitis?,"Patient: Hello doctor, I am suffering from iridocyclitis in my right eye since last six months. Every time when I stop my Pred Forte eye drops, it recurs after one month, till now it has recurred three times. I have tested for TB, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-CCP antibodies, HLAB27 all are negative. But still the problem is not going. I have hypothyroidism since last five years, my ophthalmologist is not able to find out any reason for the same. Kindly suggest what should I do, whether it is related to autoimmune disease.","Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your history and investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Well firstly iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis) is mostly an autoimmune problem. We can only find a definite cause in 30 percent cases. So, when it is a single episode we tend to ignore it but when you have recurrent episodes (more than twice a year) we need to treat it. So, even if all are negative and you are getting recurrent episodes it needs to be treated. HLAB 27 method done is an outdated one. You can request them to do by PCR method as it holds importance in your diagnosis. You can discuss with your ophthalmologist. As the treatment needs to be accelerated, we need to start you on DMARDS as for iridocyclitis only few drugs are useful. My preference would be Methotrexate but we will need to discuss with your ophthamologist once."

There is a large lump present that can be felt by touch and is visible,"Doctor: Hi.Thanks for your query.Noted the history and understood your concerns.As per the history your have provided, surgical abortion may not be directly related to the lump that has formed. This is a very very rare occurrence and hence needs to be addressed immediately by a CT scan of the abdomen and the abdominal wall to see if this is hematoma that is spreading from the operation site or a hernia that was not recognized and so on.Pain in abdomen that is spreading to the left lower quadrant can be due to the same reasons.

I have read you question completely, i understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.First I will explain about the report.It says that you father had heart attack which effected anterior wall of his heart.Heart has many walls and anterior wall is very important in determining the heart function.Report also says that there is left ventricular dysfunction..Left ventricle is also most important part of heart and now as it's damaged it is working at half the efficiency of a normal person.Normal ejection fraction is 60% and he is on 30 so after this heart attack his hearr us working at 50% of normal.Now how to keep him out of danger?These are simple yet important points.1) Save heart from a new attack, this will need him following the diet modifications and regularly taking meds ans doctor followup.2) Don't over load the heart :this will be done by:a) controlling salt intake.b) Taking medsc) Controlling BPd) Avoiding over exertion.3) Stay active but always remember he doesn't have to cross his allowed limits.. he is on 50% of heart activity so his physical activity should also be 50% Here your main goal is to keep it at 30% and dont ket it deteriorate..

35,Description: Q. Why is there a yellow spot on the gums?,"Patient: Hi doctor, I have a yellow spot on the right side of the gums. I also have a pain in the back tooth. I am taking Ibuprofen and applied Bonjela. But still, I have pain in the tooth. What could it be?","Doctor: Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like a traumatic ulcer or chemical burn. The reason can be due to the tissue present between the last two teeth. It is chewed during grinding causing a traumatic ulcer. The other reason can be a chemical burn. As the image is not clear, I am unable to differentiate them. Please mention about the age of the ulcer. The above information is necessary as the lesion itself can present as a nonhealing ulcer in the mouth. For the pain, you can take the following medications. Take Ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily. Take Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for five days. Take Ibuprofen if there is a pain."
36,Description: Can body naturally ovulate without having the hgc injection during superovulation?,"Patient: Hello, I am a 36 year old woman, 5ft 3 and about 9 1/2 stone.  Over the past few years I have been trying to conceive with my husband with no result.  We have recently just started our first cycle of superovulation and I just had a question to ask.  During superovulation can your body naturally ovulate without having the hgc injection.  It's just i was due to take the injection and i felt some pains as though i was starting to ovulate.  I have now taken the injection and i am still feeling the pains.  Does this mean i might be ovulating now (at my normal time) and not 36 hours or so after the injection was taken.  It's just that i want to get the timing right and as it is a bank holiday weekend i am not able to ask my clinic for a couple of days.  If this is the case and i am ovulating now, how long do i have in order to fertilise the egg.  Thank you",Doctor: HiIn many cases of ovulation induction we don't even prescribe Hcg injection as most women ovulate even without it. The reason the injection is prescribed is to make sure that you ovulate. So it is very much possible that you ovulated before the injection. It is generally said after ovulation the egg remains fertile for 24 hrs. Let me know if you have any other queries. Thanks

I want to know the character of pain1) Is it severe enough to disturb his daily activities or sleep2) Is it associated with vomitting3)What is the frequency of pain abdomen4) Is it occurs in morning hours only(at the time when he gets ready to go to school5) Is there any association with food6) Is he growing with normal paceNow pain abdomen for last 6 years without associated symptoms( as you have not mentioned the other symptoms I assume it to be not there)is very unlikely.

If it is there then discuss it with your physicianRegards

41,Description: Q. What is the reason for abdomen pain and poor appetite?,"Patient: Hello doctor, I am an unmarried 35-year-old male. It all started last month when I experienced mid-epigastric pain one fine morning. I took some pain relievers and got rid of that. Then, after almost a week, I got lower back pain on the right side suddenly one morning, then, upper back pain middle to the right side next day afternoon, below the right shoulder blade, which is persistent till date. I did many ultrasounds and X-rays and several blood tests. The ultrasound always said grade-1 (mild fatty liver). I got CT and MRCP first done two years ago and again last year. I then got MRCP done again thrice in the last year. Every time I am seeing the tests as 'normal'. I experienced a bit of testicular atrophy and muscle atrophy and weight loss (I went down to 70 kg from 78 kg) and less appetite. Then, I saw my abdomen protruding a bit. I gained some weight in between. (now 80 kg). Asymptomatic urination - sometimes normal urination, sometimes no urine for three to four hours. Last year, there was a small underarm swelling on my right underarm which still persists and it is painful if I press it hard. I got severe viral infections a month and two later and lost a little weight. Now, I have been experiencing severe back pain on my back, mostly on my middle to right side. Appetite is also very little. I have undergone several blood tests, CT, MRCP, lumbar-pelvic MRI, ultrasound, X-rays, etc, in these two years and did not get any specific diagnosis. I am not sure whether it is my liver, spine, bone marrow, lymph nodes, pancreas, gallbladder, or stomach that is causing this trouble. Early this year, I underwent upper GI endoscopy for my poor appetite, and the doctor discovered a small ulcer in my pyloric channel (caused by H.pylori). I was put on the triple therapy for the same, still no positive outcome. My liver enzymes (SGPT and SGOT are mildly elevated). This back pain and loss of appetite are killing me almost every day. I fear some kind of malignancy as my mother succumbed to gallbladder cancer and associated complications two years ago. The pain I am experiencing is as if something is pressing on my right side back, below the shoulder blade (referred pain). I am left out with more invasive procedures such as endoscopic ultrasound, liver biopsy, PET CT, FNAC, bone marrow biopsy, HIDA scan etc. My ESR and LDH are slightly elevated for almost a year. My sugar is under control. My lipid profile is a little bit abnormal, H. pylori IgG negative, vitamin D insufficient, testosterone is below the normal range, and kidney profile is normal.","Doctor: Hello. The scans are suggestive of a systemic disorder rather than a focal lesion, and they perfectly correlate with your symptoms. Please send your ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) levels.

46,Description: Can bloating be related to ovarian cyst?,Patient: In March 2010 i had a cervical biopsy because my pap smear came back abnormal. Lately (about 2 months) I feel bloated and tired more than usual.  My bloating looks like i'm 2-3 months pregnant.  No changes in my eating habits.  Could the bloating be related to ovarian cancer? or a cyst? No adominal or back pain. or abnormal bleeding. I am 29. I am now weighing in at 112 (104 previously) 5 feet 2.  Thanks!,"Doctor: Hi,Thanks for writing in.Bloating is a non specific symptom and might be seen in many conditions. Cysts in the ovary might cause bloating sensation and this requires clinical abdominal examination and ultrasound scan or CT scan. Any cyst in the ovary will be noted. It is also possible that there might be a condition in the uterus and this might be confirmed by clinical investigations.A pap smear is not connected to cyst in ovary. It tells about the cells in cervix. Please discuss your pap smear report with the doctor. If there is any cyst in the ovary then you might have to do additional test like CA 125 to know if there is any risk of cancer associated with the cyst. You might also get your thyroid function test done. Please do not worry."

From your history, it is evident that she has picked up an allergy, which is constantly leading her to develop mucus, and hence, her entire chest is getting congested.

Just an advise long term prolonged allergy like that can lead to asthma in the future. I will suggest the following medicine till she recovers. 1) Tablet Montek-LC (a combination of montelukast and levocetirizine) one tablet before she is about to go to work.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like Cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. For fever - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. But at this age you cannot use any medication for cold because no medicine has been licensed at this age group. For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

I was advised surgery but Osteopathy treatment improved my condition.","Doctor: Hi, Sometimes screening blood work for thyroid disease is not entirely accurate since most primary doctors will only check a TSH to detect an abnormal state.  In your case, since it appears as if low metabolic function may be to blame for your symptoms I would recommend expanding the bloodwork a bit to include several other thyroid tests such as a FREE T4, Total T3 and Free T3. I might even check a random cortisol and also look at your Vitamin D, B12, and folate levels due to the very mild anemia which may or may not be relevant to the rest of your symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Dariush Saghafi, Neurologist"
66,Description: What course of treatment should be done for fatty liver and kidney disease?,"Patient: I have recently been diagnosed with a fatty liver and kidneys. I have been going to various GI doctors for years to try to discover why I have UTIs and IBS, mostly post a perforated colon in 2004. No questions were answered. I drink only occasionally and have four hernias post 2004 colonoscopy disaster. Had a 6-month ostomy bag but have never been able to get my questions answered re treatment. I am really concerned about this fatty liver diagnosis now when no doctor paid any attention to this in the past.","Doctor: Hi, There are two main types of fatty liver disease so treatment depends on this: Alcoholic liver disease and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C. If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do. Talk to your doctor about how to get help. If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week. Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice. This should lead to improvement. You should repeat your liver markers in 3-4 weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Ivan R. Rommstein, General Surgeon"

During puberty and adolescence, there is sudden increase in hormones like testosterone and development of secondary sexual characters in boys.

82,Description: Q. Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?,"Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

92,Description: Dizzy and nauseous after taking Amoxicillin for dental infection. Allergic reaction?,"Patient: Hello, my husband had a strange thing happen at the dentist a few weeks ago. He went in for an implant on a Wed. He got 2 shots of local anesthetic because the first one didn t seem to be working/ strong enough. The dentist also found he had an infection under the crown next to the implant although he did not give my husband Amoxicillin until Friday. On Friday my husband went back to dentist for more local anesthetic and root canal . He came home around noon, ate lunch, and started Amoxicillin. From that evening he started feeling really dizzy and nauseous. On Sat he almost could not function; he was eating but almost vomited and he had to take a very long nap in the afternoon because he was just too dizzy. Slowly, over the weekend, he began to feel better and was able to drive and go to work on Mon. He kept taking Amoxicillin for 10 days. Does this seem like an allergic reaction or a toxicity from too much anesthetic? Reaction to PABA or some other chemical in anesthetic? Dentist seems to think it is an allergy to Amoxicillin .... but my husband has taken antibiotics before w/o such a reaction. Also, he began to feel strange on Thurs even BEFORE starting Amoxicillin.","Doctor: Hello, Thank you for the detailed query. However, the timeline of starting amoxicillin is a bit confusing when you say 'from that evening (i.e., Friday) he started amoxicillin' while the last sentence contradicts this. Anyway, you are right that this is unlikely a reaction to amoxicillin as he had CONTINUED to take this and was all right. If the 'dizziness' was part of a reaction to penicillin, then he would have been far worse after that! Local anaesthetic (LA) allergy or an intolerance reaction is more likely. Why I say intolerance is because occasionally adrenaline is mixed with the LA and if the injection accidentally goes into the blood stream you feel the adrenaline effects. Your husband definitely needs a full workup to ensure he is not allergic to LAs and there are several of them. Skin prick testing, followed by intradermal testing and if he does not react a subcutaneous challenge is then indicated. If he passes all these tests, he is NOT allergic.

I am suffering from pain in my left testicle from the past two days. The size is also decreased when compared to before. I visited a doctor and explained my problem to him. The doctor asked various questions regarding causes like any recent injuries in that area. There was no injury but I told him I masturbate. He said it is not the cause. There is nothing to worry about. If required, go for a doppler scan. So, I did. The report was normal. So, the doctor just prescribed a painkiller tablet. The thing is, I forgot to mention it to my doctor that I masturbate twice a day. Does that make a difference? Now, I want to know if this is something major. Will this affect my sperm count or sex life? Will using painkillers solve the problem?","Doctor: Hello. I have seen your reports and they are fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

It s been going on for about 2 months but before it started I have always felt 100% perfect and well. And it just started happening out of know where. I also feel warm and cold lately,"Doctor: Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!The fact that your urine color has changed may indicate an urinary tract infection. I recommend performing an urine analysis, an abdominal ultrasound and a complete blood test, coupled with inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). Regarding the dizziness, when changing body position, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure in sitting and standing up position. A head up tilt test may be necessary to exclude possible orthostatic intolerance. You should discuss with your attending physician on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Greetings!Dr. Iliri"

99,Description: Q. How to resume my period?,"Patient: Hi doctor, I got married last month. Since my period date was clashing with my wedding date, I had to take some medicine in order to postpone my period. My normal period cycle is 27 or 28 days, but in the last few months due to stress and exertion, I had been getting my period 5 or 6 days early. So, during the last month, I expected my period to arrive early, but that did not happen. So, I took the pill for delaying my period and unfortunately, I got my period the very next day that is four days before my marriage. My husband ejaculated right after he touched me down there. He did not even enter inside. Still, to be on the safe side, I took an I-pill the very next morning that is within less than 10 hours. So, in a span of a week from the commencement of my period till the end, I consumed two different types of medicines. I did not get my period the next month. So, I took two home pregnancy tests and luckily both the times, I got negative results. As it got delayed for 10 days, I visited a gynecologist to assure the reason behind the delay is hormonal imbalance or if I am pregnant. My gynecologist suggested an ultrasound and I got it done the same day. As per the reports I have got two follicular cysts sized as below. Right ovary 4.5 × 3.2 cm cyst size 37 × 30 mm, left ovary 3.9 ×2.3 cm and cyst size 22 × 18 mm. My uterus size is 7.6 × 4.6 × 3.2 cm. The doctor suggested that I am not pregnant as per the reports. The doctor prescribed medicine named Deviry for the withdrawal of my period. I took the medication twice a day for five days. The doctor suggested that I will get period any time within five days from the last tablet. But, I have not got them yet. I am really concerned if anything else is wrong inside or those cysts are growing. Please help me come out of this mess. I would like to know a few things. Is it fine to have intercourse with my husband? What is the ultimate option to resume my period and get rid of those two cysts? Are there any chances of those cysts harming my uterus? Please suggest me the right course of action. Thank you in advance.","Doctor: Hello. I have read and understood your query. Let me explain you that you do not have any major problem and you will get relieved by the treatment itself. Yes, you can have intercourse now at least. You have taken Deviry (Medroxyprogesterone) for five days. Actually, you should have your period within 10 days after stopping the tablets. So, do not worry. You will get your period. Just have to wait for five more days. Within five days you will get your period if what you have written is right and you have taken tablet course on time. Secondly, you have very small sized ovarian cyst. Do one sonography on day 3 of your period and if both cysts are there then you need to take treatment for cyst, otherwise they are gone with Deviry only. If they persist on day 3 sonography, then consult your doctor. He or she may prescribe Novelon (Desogestrel and Ethinylestradiol) or like tablets for 21 days straight and have a gap of seven days and start other packet of 21 tablets for three months. This will end the cyst if it is a simple cyst as per the sonographic finding. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

I am terrified that an MRI showed a growth on my pancreas. I have no symptoms of pancreatic cancer. No jaundice and no pain. However, a paternal great grandmother died of pancreatic cancer in her 60s. Please look over these notes from my chart. Worse case scenario, if the biopsy finds a malignancy, in your opinion is this something that can be operated on? Does it appear to have been caught early? I am terrified. I am an only child for my mother and I do not want to leave my mom.","Doctor: Hi. There can be many idiopathic causes of a nephrotic syndrome which respond good to medical management. As far as pancreatic mass is concerned, there are high chances for your mass to be benign lesions. So there is nothing to worry. Follow proper instructions for nephrotic syndrome. There is nothing seeming to be alarming."

125,Description: Why is my PAC s painful?,"Patient: I am 45 yr male morbid obese intermittent atrial fibrillation w frequent PACs. Tonight my PACs are painful. I have had 2 MUGA scans (EF 61) 2 chem and 1 tmst. No indication of angina or blockage. Current daily meds 250 mg Atenolol (150 mg A.M. and 100 P.M.) HCTZ/Triamterene, Aspirin (325mg) pantoprozal sodium 40mg","Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. PACs (premature atrial contractions) in atrial fibrillation (AF) are suggestive of poor rate control in AF. And you are taking only atenolol for rate control. So in my opinion, you should consult cardiologist and get done Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If rate of AF is high or frequency of PACs is high then you will need Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA). This will treat your problem permanently. Hope I have solved your query.

Your symptoms are likely to be anxiety-related, and don't seem to be typical of specific medical problem. Now, it is important to understand that anxiety can manifest itself with not only psychological symptoms, but with physical symptoms also. If you are having recurrent such symptoms or having difficulty managing your anxiety / depression, then I would advise you review with psychiatrist for further treatment. There are other effective medication like SSRI antidepressants which can help you with both your anxiety as well as depressive symptoms. In addition, there effective psychological therapies like CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) which can help you deal with your problems. Trying relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, and engaging in regular physical exercise can also be benefial in controlling your symptoms.

At the gestation of 38 weeks, there will be little space in the abdominal cavity as the womb, occupies the major space in the upper abdominal cavity, it especially true in case of short statured people, and the stomach can't move freely, and there could be abnormal movements of stomach.

My head feels weird. I just weaned completely off Zoloft three days ago. What new family of medicines do you suggest for me to try for my anxiety? Lately, I can get it under control for four to five hours taking 1/4th of a 0.25 mg of Xanax. I take a Sliver tablet of 0.25 mg three to four times a day or maybe once. Anxiety ends every day at around 3-4 PM each day and I sleep fine too.","Doctor: Hello. Considering your age, it will be difficult to try a low dose of TCA (tricyclic antidepressant), but if nothing works that is always an option. Apart from an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), there is always SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) like Venlafaxine which is pretty effective for anxiety. Also instead of Oxcarbazepine, you could try a low dose of may be 200 mg of Sodium valproate. Also, there are some dietary supplements like L-Theanine 200 mg which can be taken two times a day or on SOS basis. Finally, instead of Xanax (Alprazolam), you can try Tofisopam which is a different type of benzodiazepine with lesser addictive potential, no sedation or impairment in work performance. Also, consider doing deep breathing exercises daily and when you have an anxiety attack do more repetitions of deep breathing. Also, consider starting with yoga, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation or other types of calming exercises."

She has always had bloating of the stomach this started when she was about 3 weeks of age.  She has never slept properly. We put her on an asthma preventer a few weeks back as they think she has early signs of asthma. Last week she was hospitalised with bronchiolitis and underlying asthma. She has responded really well to the meds steroid, preventer and ventolin.  Funny since the steroids/or high dose of ventolin her bloating has eased and she is sleeping much better.

I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Its hard to answer your questions with the limited information. Couple of more questions. 1. putuitary tumor? what was the pathology that they found? 2.  severe headaches? have had these prior to the surgery? do you have a history of headaches? what have you taken for the headaches? can you tell me more about this? 3. pain on the left side of my neck and I have to hold my arm down? - could you be a little more specific and tell us what happens? 4. what kind of imaging studies have they done? MRI certainly, what about MRA and MRV. Stay well!"

192,"Description: What causes diarrhea, yellow discharge, frequent urination after IUI?","Patient: I am 4dpiui .Had pregnyl injection day before treatment.this is my 3rd iui.Symptoms are abit less than last 2 iui.But do have a touch of diarrhea,am thirsty .Have had alot of yellow discharge,also peeing lot which is also very yellow.Had a touch of heartburn in my throat,oh and some growin pains in my legs","Doctor: Hi, I think these are side effects of progesterone which you might be taking to support the implantation.  Yellow urine and frequent urination can be an indication of UTI.  So, get your urine checked for routine and microscopy and a culture.  Drink around 4 litres of water per day and take some urine alkaliser.  You may need some antibiotics.  Gastritis also occurs due to progesterone.  Yellow discharge can be due to infections.  Get yourself examined by your doctor.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Dr khushboo"

After extraction antibiotic and analgesic coverage is must to prevent infection of the extraction site and to promote healing. i would suggest you to start with a antibiotic and analgesic course consulting your dentist , which helps in subsiding the swelling and relives post extraction pain. follow all the post extraction instructions and rinse the mouth with lukewarm saline or antiseptic mouth rinse. i hope this helps , take care."
194,Description: Molar tooth got chipped twice due to metal implant and buffed out. Underlying cause?,"Patient: A new pfm bottom full bridge molar tooth got chipped due to the top metal implant just showing through the temporary top bridge, and was buffed out, then a couple weeks later that same bottom molar chipped again, can anyone be sure the structural integrity of that botttom molar is sound? Actually hasnt it now been compromised due to the repeated pecking of the top metal several hundred if not thousand times when some of the highest pressures are created? Even if a potential weak spot is not obvious, can anyone truely know how much damage was done to that molar? I wouldnt want a metal beaten ceramic tile installed on my floor, would you?",Doctor: hello thanks for your concern the metal implant is putting pressure on your pfm bridge .you need to get your bridge replaced.. the implant should crowned with porcelain so that it does not harm the opposite crown. the structural integrity of molar will remain sound unless the tooth preparation was done ideally.. even if the molar becomes weak there is a option to place post in the distal root of the molar to make it stronger enough to hold the bridge and pressure as well.. please visit your dentist for further treatment...  hope it helps
195,"Description: Trying to conceive, PCOS. Prescribed metformin. History of abortions. Will medication help me in conceiving?","Patient: I m 28yrs old,its been 3yrs tht i gt married... N had abortion twice in d first 2yrs of my marriage.. Planning fr a baby nw n diagnosed with pcos n my doc prescribed me wid metformin 850mg i hve taking it since a mnth.. Hw does it help me in.conceiving.. Pls let me knw.. V r worried abt my pregnancy... I want a healthy baby","Doctor: Hello, Thanks for posting. Metformin will help in conceiving indirectly by first of regulating your menstrual cycle (hence ovulations). The presence of PCOS will require a medication that could regulate hormonal balance of your body since imbalanced hormoone with PCOS will not be very good if you are planning to conceive. Metformin does not have any known negative effective on your future baby ( no contraindications during pregnancy). It was probably prescribed because of your size (you are probably overweight or have obesity) and this would reduce your size and hence effectuate your cycles. Metformin might require stopping by your gynobs after you have taken in (gotten pregnant). So consultation with your treating physician will be recommended. Hope this helps"
